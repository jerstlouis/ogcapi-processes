== Coastal Erosion Susceptibility Example Workflow

This annex presents a sample workflow predicting the susceptibility of coastal erosion from four data sources.
This workflow (purely intended as a demonstrative example, not to be scientificaly accurate in any way), was assembled in collaboration with Perry Peterson and Marta Padilla Ruiz from the University of Calgary
in the context of the OGC Federated Marine SDI Phase 3 Innovation Program initiative.

It demonstrates the use of the _Nested Processes_, _Collection Input_, _Input fields modifiers_ and _Output fields modifiers_ conformance classes.

The expressions used to derive field values (`"properties`") are written using the CQL2 language extended with a ternary conditional operator as found
in the C programming language and its derivatives, as well as with the ability to return not only boolean values, but also numeric values.

Note that in the case of remote processes, the derived fields (`"properties"`) specified for the _Slope_ and Aspect processes could be using either the
_Input_ or _Output field modifiers_ conformance class,
depending on whether the _Slope_ and _Aspect_ processes generating the data, or the _PassThrough_ process receiving the data, support the capability.
