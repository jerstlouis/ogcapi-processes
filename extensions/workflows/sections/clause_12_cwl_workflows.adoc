== Common Workflow Language Definitions Conformance Class

=== Requirement Class _Common Workflow Language Definitions_

The _Common Workflow Language Definitions_ conformance class specifies the use of the
https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow.html[Common Workflow Language (CWL) Workflow Description] as an alternative to an extended
_OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ execution request to define an ad-hoc workflow
(a workflow that is not first required to be deployed as a process before being executed).

The capability to deploy a CWL workflow as a process using _OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_
is already covered by a conformance class of Part 2.

*TODO*: Verify that a CWL conformance class already exists or is planned for _Part 2_.

*TODO*: Verify and describe which (if any) of the other conformance classes defined in this extension applies to ad-hoc CWL workflows.
