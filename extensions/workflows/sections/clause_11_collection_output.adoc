== Collection Output Conformance Class

=== Requirement Class _Collection Output_

The _Collection Output_ conformance class specifies how clients can trigger the
execution of a process or workflow for a specific area, time and resolution of interest
as a result of requesting output data using OGC API data access mechanisms, such as
_OGC API - Tiles_, _DGGS_, _Coverages_, _Features_, _EDR_, or _Maps_.

This provides an alternative to the synchronous and asynchronous execution mechanisms
defined in _OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ for which area, time and resolution of interest
are hardcoded in the execution request. With _Core_, when lengthy batch processing is not desirable,
completely new execution requests returning a partial output must continuously be re-submitted.

This conformance class allows to submit an execution request once and then access the output
using mechanisms widely supported by clients in a manner completely agnostic of process execution.

Compared to separate execution requests, this mechanism makes it easier for implementations to optimize
for scenarios where clients will stream small partial outputs from the same pre-established processing
pipeline. Parsing the execution request, validating inputs, and handshakes with remote components of a workflow
only need to be performed once. An implementation could also preempt future requests based on past requests,
offsetting the latency of a complex distributed workflow.

A collection document resulting from a workflow MAY provide a link to its source the definition of the
workflow dgenerating it (link relation type: `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/workflow`).

A service MAY also support deploying a workflow as a persistent collection e.g., by supporting a `POST`
method for the `/collections` end-point accepting a JSON workflow definition (execution request) as payload.

The following requirements describe an execution mechanism where a client is redirected (using a `303` _See Other_ HTTP
status code and a `Location:` header)
to an OGC API landing page or collection description document,
which provides links to request output data using standard OGC API data access mechanisms, triggering on-demand processing
for a particular area, time and resolution of interest.

==== Collection Response

A request for a collection response is only valid for an execution request generating or selecting a single output
which can be retrieved using an OGC API data access mechanism.

==== Landing Page Response

A request for a landing page response is valid for an execution request generating one or more outputs
which can be retrieved using an OGC API data access mechanism.
